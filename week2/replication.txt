Objective - To create a 3 node mongodb cluster with two secondary replcia database with one having read-oly and delay of 1hr.
We will be doing this assignment by using docker and docker network.

STEP-1
pull the mongo docker image from the command given below.
docker pull mongo

STEP-2
now we will make a docker network by the name of "week2-mongo-cluster". To that run the command-
docker network create week2-mongo-cluster

STEP-3
Now we will run 3 mongo instances in the network "week2-mongo-cluster" and also make a replica set by the name "rs0", in daemon using the -d parameter.
run the following commands for this -
1. docker run -d --name mongo-node-1 --net week2-mongo-cluster mongo --replSet "rs0"
2. docker run -d --name mongo-node-2 --net week2-mongo-cluster mongo --replSet "rs0"
3. docker run -d --name mongo-node-3 --net week2-mongo-cluster mongo --replSet "rs0"

This will start 3 instances of mongo image

STEP-4
use the docker exec command to use the first container-
docker run -it mongo-node-1 mongo

You will now be in the mongo interface of the mongo-node-1 container.

STEP-6
make a config document given below-

config = {
      "_id" : "rs0",
      "members" : [
          {
              "_id" : 0,
              "host" : "mongo-node-1:27017"
          },
          {
              "_id" : 1,
              "host" : "mongo-node-2:27017"
          },
          {
              "_id" : 2,
              "host" : "mongo-node-3:27017",
              "priority" : 0,
              "slaveDelay": 3600,
              "hidden": true
          }
      ]
  }

here host with the name "mongo-node-3:27017" is the read only slave replica with dealy of 1Hr and this node cannot be a primary node.

STEP-7
run the following command to initiate the above config document-
rs.initiate(config)

STEP-8
now you can log into other containers and set the salve status by the following commands-
rs.slaveOk(true)

OBSERVATION-
you will observe that data gets replciated instantly in "mongo-node-2" but in "mongo-node-3" it will take 1hr to get a replica.
